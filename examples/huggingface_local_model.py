# Title: Use HuggingFace Models Locally
#
# Description:
# This script demonstrates how to run a model from Hugging Face locally on your machine.
# Unlike the previous API methods (which run in the cloud), this method downloads
# the model weights to your computer and runs them using your own CPU/GPU.
#
# This uses the `transformers` library, which is the standard for running
# Hugging Face models.
#
# Installation:
# pip install transformers torch
# (You might also need `accelerate` or `bitsandbytes` depending on the model)
#
# How to run:
# python huggingface_local_model.py
#
# --- IMPORTANT: MANAGING DISK SPACE ---
# Hugging Face models are LARGE (Gigabytes). They are stored in a cache folder.
# Default Cache Location:
# - Windows: C:\Users\<Username>\.cache\huggingface\hub
# - Mac/Linux: ~/.cache/huggingface/hub
#
# How to DELETE a model:
# 1. Option A (Manual): Go to the cache folder above and delete folders
#    named "models--..."
# 2. Option B (CLI): Install the CLI tool: `pip install huggingface_hub[cli]`
#    Then run: `hf cache scan` (to see models)
#    Then run: `hf cache delete` (to interactively delete them)

# Use a pipeline as a high-level helper.
# The 'pipeline' abstraction handles downloading, tokenizing, and running
# the model for you.
from transformers import pipeline

# Initialize the pipeline.
# task="text-generation": Tells the library what kind of job we want to do.
# model="LiquidAI/LFM2.5-1.2B-Thinking": The specific model ID on Hugging Face Hub.
#
# Note: The first time you run this, it will DOWNLOAD the model (could be several GBs).
# Subsequent runs will use the cached version.
pipe = pipeline("text-generation", model="LiquidAI/LFM2.5-1.2B-Thinking")

# Define the input prompt.
# Many modern models expect a list of messages (Chat format).
messages = [
    {"role": "user", "content": "What is the Sonic Boom in Aviation?"},
]

# Run the model with CUSTOM PARAMETERS.
#
# Arguments Explained:
# 1. max_new_tokens (int): The maximum number of *new* words the model can generate.
#    Increasing this prevents the answer from being cut off mid-sentence.
#    Default is often low (50-100).
#
# 2. do_sample (bool):
#    - True: The model picks the next word randomly (Creative/Varied).
#    - False: Always picks the most likely next word (Deterministic).
#
# 3. temperature (float, 0.0 - 1.0+): Controls randomness/creativity.
#    - Low (e.g., 0.1): Predictable, focused. Good for coding or math.
#    - High (e.g., 0.9): Creative, diverse. Good for poetry or brainstorming.
#    - Note: Only works if do_sample=True.
#
# 4. top_k (int): Limits random choice to the top K most likely words.
#    - e.g., top_k=50: "Only consider the 50 best words for next step".
#    - Helps prevent the model choosing very weird/nonsense words.
#
# 5. top_p (float, 0.0 - 1.0): Nucleus Sampling.
#    - e.g., top_p=0.9: "Consider words whose probabilities sum to 90%".
#    - A more dynamic version of top_k.

output = pipe(
    messages,
    max_new_tokens=5024, # Generate up to 1024 new tokens
    do_sample=True,      # Enable sampling (required for temperature/top_k/top_p)
    temperature=0.7,  # Balance between creativity and coherence
    top_k=50,  # Limit to top 50 likely words
    top_p=0.5
    # Nucleus sampling for better quality
)

# The result is a list — [0]['generated_text'] holds the full answer.
# [1]['content'] is specific to how this model returns the chat history.
# print(output)
print(output[0]["generated_text"][1]["content"].split("</think>")[1])
